# NBA All-Star Prediction Project

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a **machine learning model** to predict whether an NBA player will be selected as an **All-Star** based on their **seasonal performance metrics**. By leveraging historical data from **2011 to 2024**, we will analyze player statistics, explore feature importance, and build predictive models to determine what factors contribute to All-Star selection.

---

## **Objectives**

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**

   - Gather NBA player statistics from **2011 to 2024**.
   - Integrate **All-Star selections** into the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and clean inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Identify statistical differences between **All-Stars and Non-All-Stars**.
   - Analyze correlations between key features and All-Star status.
   - Visualize trends in **scoring, efficiency, and impact metrics** over time.

3. **Feature Engineering & Selection**

   - Identify the most influential stats in predicting All-Star selection.
   - Create new metrics such as **player efficiency rating, usage rate, and plus-minus impact**.
   - Perform **dimensionality reduction (PCA, SHAP analysis)** to enhance model performance.

4. **Model Development & Training**

   - Train **classification models** such as **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.
   - Evaluate model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
   - Interpret model outputs using **SHAP values** for feature importance.

5. **Prediction & Model Validation**

   - Test model predictions on recent seasons (2023-2024).
   - Identify potential **snubs** (players who performed like All-Stars but were not selected).
   - Compare model predictions to **actual All-Star selections**.

6. **Data Visualization & Deployment**

   - Build an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to explore All-Star trends.
   - Deploy a **Streamlit web app** for real-time player predictions.
   - Allow users to input **custom player stats** to predict **All-Star likelihood**.

### **Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

âœ… Identify **key differences** between All-Stars and Non-All-Stars.\
âœ… Visualize trends in **PPG, PER, usage rate, and plus-minus**.\
âœ… Create **correlation heatmaps** and **feature importance plots.**

### **Phase 3: Feature Engineering & Model Training**

âœ… Engineer new features like **efficiency rating, scoring impact, and player roles**.\
âœ… Train **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** classifiers.\
âœ… Evaluate models using **precision, recall, and F1-score**.

### **Phase 4: Model Prediction & Interpretation**

âœ… Predict **2023-2024** All-Stars and compare with real selections.\
âœ… Identify **underrated players** based on model predictions.\
âœ… Use **SHAP values** to explain **feature importance**.

### **Phase 5: Deployment & Visualization**
